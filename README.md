My final project uses data from Kaggle to predict whether a product will go backorder based on its supplier and sales information. I was in charge of developing business understanding, data preparation, modeling and evaluation, and organizing workflow. My teammates and I also created a deck and presented our project in class, which can be found in this repository with name 'ML Project.pdf'.
